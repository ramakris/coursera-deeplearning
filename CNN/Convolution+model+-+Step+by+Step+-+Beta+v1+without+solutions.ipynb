You should use an `if/elif` statement to see if the mode is equal to `'max'` or `'average'`. If it is equal to 'average' you should use the `distribute_value()` function you implemented above to create a matrix of the same shape as `a_slice`. Else, the mode is equal to `max`, you will create a mask with `create_mask_from_window()` and multiply it by the corresponding value of dZ."
